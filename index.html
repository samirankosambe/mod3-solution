            Chicken is easy to prepare in a healthy way by grilling, roasting, sauteing, poaching, stir-frying and baking. According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, we should be eating lean sources of protein, including chicken. It is recommended to remove the visible fat and skin from chicken before eating to decrease unnecessary calories from fat.
            Conventionally raised chickens are often treated with antibiotics in order to make them grow faster or combat the effects of crowded living conditions. The high usage of antibiotics has led to an increased risk of bacteria developing antibiotic resistance. While they offer different pros and cons, free-range, organic and local poultry can provide more eco-friendly alternatives but cost a pretty penny.
            Salmonella is another concern with chicken. The government no longer tests poultry for salmonella, instead we rely on preventative measures to keep our food safe. This includes food safety procedures from the slaughterhouse to the supermarket, which are checked by food inspectors (AKA sanitarians). It also means that consumers need to be careful how they handle raw chicken including preventing cross-contamination with ready-to-eat foods like fruits and veggies and making sure the chicken is cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit.
            Chicken stock tends to be made more from bony parts, whereas chicken broth is made more out of meat. Chicken stock tends to have a fuller mouth feel and richer flavor, due to the gelatin released by long-simmering bones.
            Canned low-sodium chicken broth is the busy home-cook's best friend. If you've got an extra few minutes, enhance its flavor by adding any combination of the following and simmering for as long as you can: carrots, onions, leeks, celery, fennel, parsley, bay leaf, black peppercorns, or garlic. That'll help the flavor tremendously.
            Enriching store-bought broth still won't give you the full stock experience, but unless you're making something like chicken noodle soup, where you really do want the stocky mouth feel, it's a great timesaver.
